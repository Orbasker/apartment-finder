# Design System — Apartment Finder

The product is a Hebrew-only, RTL, mobile-first apartment alert service for Tel Aviv. The design is intentionally quiet: clean borders, subtle shadows, flat surfaces, and a single brand accent — no gradients anywhere. The interface is dense with information but never noisy.

## Principles

1. **Mobile-first, always.** Every layout is designed at ~375px first, scaled up with `sm:` and `md:`. No layout collapses gracefully — they grow gracefully.
2. **Hebrew + RTL is native, not retrofitted.** `dir="rtl"` on `<html>`, `start-/end-` instead of `left-/right-`, `<bdi>` around numbers, English brand names sit inside Hebrew sentences via `<bdi>` automatically.
3. **Content first.** Generous whitespace, restrained type scale, single accent color. Decoration only appears when it carries meaning (the AI brain pulse, animated particles in the flow diagram).
4. **Token-driven theming.** Light and dark are first-class and switched via a `.dark` class on `<html>`. Every color is a CSS variable, not a Tailwind palette name.

## Color tokens

Defined in `apps/web/app/globals.css` using OKLch (perceptually uniform). All UI references these — never raw hex.

| Token | Light | Dark | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--color-background` | `oklch(0.99 0 0)` | `oklch(0.16 0 0)` | Page surface |
| `--color-foreground` | `oklch(0.14 0 0)` | `oklch(0.96 0 0)` | Body text |
| `--color-card` | `oklch(1 0 0)` | `oklch(0.2 0 0)` | Card / panel surface |
| `--color-muted` | `oklch(0.96 0 0)` | `oklch(0.24 0 0)` | Secondary surface, hover |
| `--color-muted-foreground` | `oklch(0.45 0 0)` | `oklch(0.68 0 0)` | Secondary text |
| `--color-border` | `oklch(0.92 0 0)` | `oklch(0.28 0 0)` | All borders, dividers |
| `--color-input` | same as border | same as border | Input borders |
| `--color-ring` | `oklch(0.64 0.15 240)` | `oklch(0.7 0.15 240)` | Focus ring (single blue) |
| `--color-primary` | `oklch(0.22 0 0)` | `oklch(0.96 0 0)` | Primary action (near-black flips in dark) |
| `--color-primary-foreground` | inverse | inverse | Text on primary |
| `--color-destructive` | `oklch(0.6 0.22 27)` | `oklch(0.68 0.22 27)` | Delete / error |

**Brand accent.** The single non-neutral color used in the landing page is the AI accent `oklch(0.55 0.17 265)` (light) / `oklch(0.78 0.15 265)` (dark) — used for eyebrow labels, the highlighted word in the headline, the "AI" pill, and the brain glow. Used sparingly to mark the AI as "the smart part of the product." It is always applied as a solid color — never as a gradient.

## Typography

- **Family.** System UI stack via `font-sans` (no custom font files — RTL Hebrew rendering is best on the user's installed system fonts).
- **Scale.**
  - Display headline: `text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-[2.6rem]` + `tracking-tight font-semibold`
  - Section title: `text-xl sm:text-2xl` + `tracking-tight font-semibold`
  - Eyebrow: `text-xs uppercase tracking-wider font-semibold` (in accent color)
  - Body: `text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed`
  - UI label: `text-sm font-medium`
  - Microcopy: `text-xs` / `text-[11px]`
- **Numbers.** Always wrapped in `<bdi>` to prevent RTL flipping. Use `tabular-nums` when columns of numbers must align.

## Spacing & layout

- **Container.** App pages: `max-w-3xl`. Landing page: `max-w-5xl`. Login card: `max-w-md`. Dashboard content: `max-w-2xl`.
- **Page padding.** `px-4 py-4 sm:px-6 sm:py-6` — never less on mobile.
- **Section rhythm.** Major landing sections separated by `mt-16 sm:mt-24`.
- **Stack gap.** `gap-2` (tight), `gap-3` (default), `gap-4–6` (loose).
- **Card padding.** `p-4` (compact) / `p-5` (default, from `Card`) / `p-6 sm:p-10` (hero-card).

## Radii & elevation

- `rounded-md` — buttons, inputs, small badges
- `rounded-lg` — cards, panels
- `rounded-xl` — icon tiles in the flow diagram
- `rounded-2xl` — chat bubbles, hero CTA card
- `rounded-full` — pills, status dots, avatar-like marks

Shadows are minimal: `shadow-sm` on cards, none on buttons. Elevation comes from borders + background contrast, not blur.

## Components

Lives in `apps/web/src/components/ui/`. Imported via `@/components/ui/...`.

- **`Button`** — CVA variants `default | outline | ghost | destructive` × sizes `default | sm | lg | icon`. Default height `h-9`; landing CTAs use `h-11`. Always include `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring`.
- **`Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardContent`** — `rounded-lg border bg-background shadow-sm`. Header has bottom border and `p-5`.
- **`Input`** — `h-9 text-sm` default; landing/onboarding bumps to `h-11 text-base` for thumb reach. Numeric inputs get `dir="ltr"` so digits read naturally.
- **`Spinner`** — small SVG, `animate-spin`, currentColor.
- **`ThemeToggle`** — Moon/Sun via lucide-react, persists to `localStorage`.

The landing page composes these primitives plus its own decorative components:

- `FlowDiagram` (`app/welcome/flow-diagram.tsx`) — the SVG animation; pure CSS/SVG, no JS animation library.
- `AiExtractor` (`app/welcome/ai-extractor.tsx`) — looped state machine that re-runs the "raw → structured" reveal.
- `ChatPreview` (`app/welcome/chat-preview.tsx`) — scripted messages with typing indicator; mirrors the production onboarding chat exactly (same bubbles, same RTL alignment).

## RTL conventions

- HTML root: `<html lang="he" dir="rtl">`.
- **Logical properties.** `start-*` / `end-*` / `ms-auto` / `me-auto` / `ps-*` / `pe-*` instead of left/right. Tailwind's `rtl:` variant only used when behavior must differ between LTR/RTL (e.g. drawer translate).
- **Bubble alignment in RTL.** `justify-start` puts content on the right (the "outgoing" side for the user); `justify-end` puts it on the left ("incoming" assistant). This is intentional and matches WhatsApp/Telegram conventions in Hebrew.
- **Mixed-script text.** Hebrew prose containing English brand names ("נסרק מ-Yad2") relies on the browser's default bidi algorithm. Numbers and explicit LTR runs use `<bdi>` to prevent stray flips.
- **Brand names.** Always written in Latin script in the UI (Yad2, Madlan, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, Email) — they are recognized this way by Hebrew speakers.

## Animation

No animation library is installed (no Framer Motion). All motion is:

- **CSS transitions** for hover/focus/state changes on Tailwind utilities (`transition-colors`, `transition-all`).
- **CSS keyframes** for ambient motion (`animate-spin`, `animate-ping`).
- **Native SVG `<animate>` and `<animateMotion>`** for the flow diagram particles. This is intentional — it keeps the page free of JS-driven animation cost, runs at 60fps in every modern browser, and means the diagram is purely a server-rendered SVG.

Motion is never decorative. Each particle on the flow diagram represents a piece of data flowing from a source to the AI, or a notification flowing from the AI to a destination — the animation literally describes the product.

### Flow diagram coordinate system
The flow diagram (`app/_landing/flow-diagram.tsx`) uses a single coordinate system shared by both the SVG (paths and particles) and the CSS-positioned icon tiles. The container is `aspect-square w-full max-w-md`. The SVG inside has `viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none"` so its 100-unit grid maps 1:1 to CSS percentages of the container. Icon tiles are absolutely positioned with `style={{ left: \`${cx}%\`, top: \`${cy}%\` }}` and translated by 50% so their centers sit exactly on the path endpoints (e.g. Facebook at `(15, 18)`, brain at `(50, 50)`, Email at `(85, 82)`). RTL is handled in CSS only (logical `start-/end-` would diverge from the SVG's LTR coordinates), so the icon order is hard-coded for RTL layout: rightmost source = Yad2, leftmost destination = Telegram.

## Iconography

- **App icons** — `lucide-react` (Menu, X, Moon, Sun, etc.). Stroke icons, currentColor, sized via `h-4 w-4`.
- **Brand marks** — `app/_landing/brand-icons.tsx`. Each is a `48×48` rounded tile (`rounded-xl`) with the brand's solid color and the actual brand glyph in white. Sources are real artwork: Yad2's logo loaded from their CDN as an `<img>`, the official Madlan leaf path, and the Facebook "f". Destinations use [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) CC0 SVG paths for WhatsApp and Telegram (translated 12px into the 48-unit viewBox to leave a consistent 25% padding); email uses a custom envelope.
- **AI brain (`BrainMark`)** — follows the Material/Google AI pattern: solid circle in the brand accent, white `Brain` glyph from `lucide-react`, a soft static `ring-8` halo, and a Tailwind `animate-ping` layer behind for the radar-pulse effect. No gradients, no glow filters — just three solid layers.

## Page-level patterns

### Landing (`/`, public, auth-aware)
The root URL is the marketing page. Middleware excludes `/` from auth checks so visitors land here without a session, but the page itself does an `await getCurrentUser()` and switches CTAs based on state:
- **Logged out**: header shows "כניסה" + "התחלה"; primary CTA → `/login`; chat CTA → `/login`.
- **Logged in**: header shows "לדשבורד"; primary CTA → `/dashboard`; chat CTA → `/onboarding`. Final-CTA copy switches from "הדירה הבאה שלך כנראה כבר פורסמה" to "ממשיכים מהמקום שעצרנו".

The page is composed top-down:
1. **Slim public header** — brand wordmark, theme toggle, auth-aware buttons.
2. **Hero** — eyebrow pill, headline with one word in the brand accent color, supporting paragraph, two CTAs, bullet list. The flow diagram is the visual; on mobile it stacks above the copy, on desktop it sits to the left (`md:order-2` on the copy column lets RTL readers see the diagram on the right).
3. **"How it works"** — three numbered cards.
4. **AI Extractor** — split panel: raw Hebrew listing on one side, animated structured fields on the other.
5. **Chat preview** — replicates the real onboarding UI exactly, with three bullet-cards explaining the value to its right.
6. **Final CTA** — flat `bg-card` panel with rounded corners, single H2, two buttons; copy switches with auth state.

### Authenticated app (`/dashboard`, `/filters`, `/onboarding`)
Wrapped in `(app)/layout.tsx`: a `max-w-3xl` container with a header (mobile hamburger or desktop nav). Content uses `Card` blocks with internal section headers. The brand wordmark and "בית" link both point to `/dashboard`.

### Login (`/login`)
Full-screen centered `max-w-md` card. The login layout is intentionally distinct from both the landing and the app shell — it's a transition surface.

## Accessibility

- Skip-link at the root layout (`دلگ לתוכן` → `#main-content`).
- All interactive elements have `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring`.
- Decorative SVGs use `aria-hidden="true"`. Live regions (chat) use `role="log" aria-live="polite"`.
- Color contrast: foreground/background pairs all clear WCAG AA in both themes.
- `prefers-color-scheme` is honored on first visit; explicit toggle wins after that.

## What this design is NOT

- Not a flashy SaaS landing. No floating cards, no parallax, no 3D, no gradients — anywhere. Surfaces are flat, accents are solid.
- Not a "just shadcn defaults" look — colors are slightly warmer (OKLch-derived), borders are slightly softer, the AI accent is one specific blue-violet that appears nowhere else.
- Not LTR-with-RTL-bolted-on. The visual hierarchy reads right-to-left throughout, including the chat bubble alignment and the flow diagram's vertical composition.
